### Goal

The goal of this project was to create an app that tracks goals. The main focus wasnt the app functionality, I built this using a tutorial so that i have a minimal app that has a functionality and users. 

  

### Users should be able to:

  

 - Create an account (Register)
 - Log in / Log out
 - Create new goals
 - See all of their goals
 - Edit the goals they created
 - Delete the goals they created
